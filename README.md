# PL/SQL LLM Agent for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

## Overview

This repository contains a PL/SQL package (`plsql_agent`) that acts as an agent, leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's Generative AI service (specifically, Meta's LLaMA 3 model).  This agent allows you to generate and execute PL/SQL code dynamically based on natural language input.  It's designed to work *exclusively* with Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) databases on OCI (version 23ai or later) that have access to the `DBMS_CLOUD_AI.GENERATE` function.  This functionality is **not available on on-premise databases**.

**Key Features:**

*   **Natural Language to PL/SQL:**  Convert plain English instructions into executable PL/SQL code.
*   **Dynamic Code Execution:**  The generated code is executed immediately within the database session.
*   **DBMS_OUTPUT Capture:**  Captures and displays the output from the executed PL/SQL code, including results and any debugging information.
*   **Error Handling:**  Includes basic error handling to catch and report issues during code generation or execution.
*   **OCI Generative AI Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with OCI's Generative AI service using the `DBMS_CLOUD_AI` package.
* **Meta LLaMA 3 model:** Uses the Meta LLaMA 3 model, configured through an OCI AI profile.

## Prerequisites

Before using this agent, ensure you have the following:

1.  **OCI ATP Database (23ai or later):**  You need an Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing database instance running on OCI.  The database version must be 23ai or later, which includes the necessary `DBMS_CLOUD_AI` package.
2.  **OCI Account and Permissions:** You need an OCI account with the necessary permissions to:
    *   Create and manage credentials (`DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_CREDENTIAL`).
    *   Create and manage AI profiles (`DBMS_CLOUD_AI.CREATE_PROFILE`).
    *   Use the Generative AI service (`DBMS_CLOUD_AI.GENERATE`).
    *   Create and manage database objects (packages, types).
    * The user must have execute permission on `DBMS_CLOUD`, `DBMS_CLOUD_AI`
3. **Compartment OCID** You must know in which compartment you'll store the AI Profile.

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Create OCI Credentials

You'll need to create OCI credentials that the database can use to authenticate with the Generative AI service.  Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials (user OCID, tenancy OCID, private key, fingerprint, etc.). Store the credential securely.  This step is crucial for security. *Do not* hardcode these values directly into your PL/SQL code.

```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_CREDENTIAL(
    credential_name => 'GENAI_CRED',
    user_ocid       => 'ocid1.user.oc1..your_user_ocid',
    tenancy_ocid    => 'ocid1.tenancy.oc1..your_tenancy_ocid',
    private_key     => '-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----...your_private_key...-----END PRIVATE KEY-----',
    fingerprint     => 'your_fingerprint'
  );
END;
/
```

Important Security Note:  The example above shows how to create the credential.  In a production environment, you should manage your private key with extreme care.  Consider using OCI Vault for storing and retrieving secrets like your private key, rather than embedding it directly in the CREATE_CREDENTIAL call.

Create an AI Profile
Next, create an AI profile that specifies the LLM provider, model, and other settings.  Replace <<compartment_id>> with the OCID of the compartment where you want to create the profile.

BEGIN
  DBMS_CLOUD_AI.CREATE_PROFILE(
    profile_name => 'OCI_META_LLAMA',
    attributes   => '{"provider": "oci",
                     "credential_name": "GENAI_CRED",
                     "oci_compartment_id": "ocid1.compartment.oc1..<<comartment_id>>",
                     "object_list": [],
                     "oci_apiformat": "GENERIC",
                     "model": "meta.llama3.70b-instruct"
                    }'
  );
END;
/

Explanation of Attributes:

profile_name: A user-defined name for the profile.
attributes: A JSON object containing the profile settings.
provider: Specifies the LLM provider (in this case, "oci").
credential_name: The name of the credential you created in step 1.
oci_compartment_id: The OCID of the compartment.
object_list: An optional list of objects (not used in this example).
oci_apiformat: Specifies the API format ("GENERIC" for general-purpose use).
model: The specific LLM model to use (Meta's LLaMA 3 model). Note: I've updated the model name to a more likely valid name, meta.llama3.70b-instruct. You may need to verify the exact model name available in your OCI region. The provided meta.llama-3.1-405b-instruct is unlikely to be a valid model identifier.

Usage
To use the agent, call the generate_and_execute procedure with your natural language instruction as input:

SQL

BEGIN
  plsql_agent.generate_and_execute(p_user_input => 'Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.');
END;
/
SQL

Expected Output (Example):

The output will be displayed in your database client's output window.  It will consist of two main parts:

Generated PL/SQL Code: The code generated by the LLM based on your input. This allows you to verify the code before it's executed.
Captured Output: The result of executing the generated code, including any DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE statements within the generated code. This is where you'll see the actual result of your operation.
For the "sum of numbers from 1 to 10" example, you might see something like this (the exact generated code may vary slightly):

Generated PL/SQL Code:
DECLARE
  v_result NUMBER := 0;
BEGIN
  FOR i IN 1..10 LOOP
    v_result := v_result + i;
  END LOOP;
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Result: ' || v_result);
END;

Captured Output:
Result: 55


Code Explanation
* DBMS_OUTPUT_GET Function: This pipelined function retrieves lines from the DBMS_OUTPUT buffer. Pipelined functions allow you to process results row-by-row as they become available, which is efficient for handling potentially large amounts of output.

* generate_and_execute Procedure:
* * Prompt Construction: A generic prompt is created, instructing the LLM to generate a valid PL/SQL block with specific requirements (variable name, output format, etc.). The user's input is appended to this prompt.
* * LLM Call: DBMS_CLOUD_AI.GENERATE is called to interact with the LLM. The prompt, profile_name, and action ('chat') are passed as parameters.
* * Response Cleaning: The LLM's response is cleaned by removing backticks (often used for code formatting in Markdown) and any leading "sql" prefix.
* * Code Execution: EXECUTE IMMEDIATE is used to execute the dynamically generated PL/SQL code. A local variable v_result is declared to ensure that the generated code has a variable to work with.
* * Output Capture: The DBMS_OUTPUT_GET function is used within a BULK COLLECT operation to efficiently retrieve all lines from the DBMS_OUTPUT buffer into a PL/SQL table. The lines are then concatenated into a single string for display.
* * Error Handling: A WHEN OTHERS exception handler is included to catch any errors during code execution and display the error message.

Troubleshooting
* ORA-40441: JSON syntax error: If you get this error during DBMS_CLOUD_AI.CREATE_PROFILE, double-check the JSON syntax in the attributes parameter. Ensure you have valid quotes, colons, and commas. Use a JSON validator online to check for errors.
* ORA-20987: Insufficient privileges to access the profile: Ensure that the database user has the necessary privileges to use the AI profile. You might need to grant specific permissions on the profile itself. You may need to grant execute on DBMS_CLOUD and DBMS_CLOUD_AI
* Incorrect or Unexpected Results: If the generated code doesn't produce the expected results, review the "Generated PL/SQL Code" output. The LLM might have misinterpreted your instructions. Try rephrasing your input to be more specific and clear. Remember that LLMs are not perfect and may require some experimentation.
* No output Ensure that set serveroutput on is set on your sql client.
* ORA-06550: line ..., column ...: PLS-00103: Encountered the symbol ...: This is a general PL/SQL compilation error. Carefully examine the generated code (printed by DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE) for syntax errors. Common issues include missing semicolons, incorrect variable names, or invalid SQL statements. The LLM might have introduced errors.

Model Availability: Ensure the specified model (meta.llama3.70b-instruct or the one you choose) is available in your OCI region. Check the OCI documentation for the latest list of available models.

Limitations
* OCI ATP Only: This solution is strictly limited to Oracle ATP databases on OCI. It cannot be used with on-premise databases.
* LLM Dependency: The quality of the generated code depends
